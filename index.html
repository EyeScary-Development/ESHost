    <p>Picture this, you finished making your website and you're ready to host i..... oh, you don't know how to start hosting your website, and you don't want to sign up for an account.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This is the solution, it's a simple website hosting service that allows you to have as many websites as you want, wihout any sign-ups, just paste your code below, hit enter and you'll recieve the url for your website to keep in a safe place</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<form id="codeForm" onsubmit="return createURL()" style="display:block;">
    <input style="text-align:center;width:100%" type="text" id="codebox" placeholder="paste your website here and press enter">
</form>

    <h3>So how does this work?</h3>
    <p>It's fairly simple, to be fair, we simply take your html code, encode it with base64 and add it as a custom code url parameter to a blank html file, meaning your code goes in the place of the basic file. This method has drawbacks, like really long urls and breakages because of those, but rest assured, we are working on those for future updates.</p>
